# ADS_Final_Project
Final Project for MAST30034 Applied Data Science

Summary of the notebooks:

Each notebook name starts with the code number. The code numbers represent:
1. : EDA and Initial Models: Contains the code for the analysis of the dataset and training and testing of the naive models. 
2. : Contains the architecture of the Neural Network and its hyperparameter tuning
3. : Contains the adversarial attacks and defense strategies 
(This file was used in Google Colab and might need some alternations to work in Jupyter Notebook)

Please keep in mind that, that training and testing the final neural network takes about 1 hour on the Virtual Machine. The adversarial examples take approximately 1.5 hours to generate. 

Output CSVs:

Output csvs are present in the "CSVdata" folder. Like notebooks the Output CSVs have a coded suffix. The code number represents:
1. : Outputs for the hyperparamter tuning
2. : Outputs for the adversarial attacks and defenses

Folders:
1. Archive: Contains notebooks and files that are not relevant anymore
2. CSVdata: Contains the CSV files of the outputs generated
